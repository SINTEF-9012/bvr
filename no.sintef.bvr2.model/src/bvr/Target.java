Constraints talk about Targets.</p><p>The substance of what a VSpec is about does not necessarily mean a piece of the base model, but may sometimes refer to exactly that. The essence of "substance" is that the same abstract decision can be reached in different ways in the VSpec tree (variability model).</p>
