Implementation of the MiniSAT specification in Java.

Some classes have been added in order to allow testing several heuristics aand learning scheme
but the solver is still very close to the original MiniSAT.

For sake of efficiency, some tradeoff with OOP were made: literals are here represented by integers
whose attributes are stored in a Lits (vocabulary) object.

A factory of solvers is provided for a friendly access to prebuilt solvers.
